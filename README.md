##I. Introduction
This document outlines the development plan for the WWC Converter App, which simplifies currency conversion on Android devices, providing a streamlined user experience.

##II. Project Description
WWC Converter is designed to offer quick and easy access to currency conversion for individuals who need straightforward solutions without the complexity of financial tools. This app is particularly useful for travelers and those managing finances in multiple currencies.

##III. Problem Addressing
The app reduces the complexity typically associated with financial applications. It aids users in quick financial decision-making by providing a simplified interface for currency conversion, initially using hardcoded rates to demonstrate functionality.

##IV. Platform
The app is developed using Android Studio, targeting Android devices with compatibility starting from Android 5.0 (Lollipop), ensuring wide accessibility.

##V. Front/Back End Support
Front End: The interface is designed using XML within Android Studio, emphasizing ease of use and clear navigation.
Back End: Currently utilizes hardcoded currency conversion rates for demonstration purposes. The deployed version of the app will include integration with a real-time currency exchange rate API to provide accurate and up-to-date information.

##VI. Functionality
Currency Conversion: Allows users to convert between several major currencies using hardcoded exchange rates to demonstrate functionality.
Favorites: Enables users to save and quickly access frequently used currencies.

##VII. Design
Home Screen: Features a single, simple layout where users can select currencies from dropdown menus, enter an amount, and view the converted result instantly.
Wireframes: A detailed wireframe has been developed to plan and demonstrate the layout clearly, available in the Wiki section of the GitHub repository.

##Final Version Note
This is the final version of the project for the course submission. While the current implementation uses hardcoded rates for demonstration, future iterations planned for deployment will utilize live data via an API to ensure real-time accuracy in currency conversion.
